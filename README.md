# cycle-phase-ai
A tiny Flutter app that estimates cycle phase from LMP + cycle length and asks Gemini to generate context-specific advice (what to do/say &amp; what not to say). Three screens: input → contexts → AI output. No third-party packages; supports proxy or runs in local fallback (no key). Respectful &amp; consent-first.
